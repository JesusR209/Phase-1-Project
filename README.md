# Phase-1-Project

## Color Scale
This is a simple to use interactive website that converts any amount of grams into pounds, kilograms, ounces, and even stones!

### Requirements 
* Have json-server installed

### Installation Instructions
* Fork and clone
* Run JSON server for db.json (json-server --watch db.json)
* Open index.html in the browser

### How to Use Color Scale
Simply add the desired number of grams you would like to convert, then choose the measurement conversion you'd like to convert the grams into in the drop down menu, then 'click' "Convert" and Color Scale will handle the mathematics and provide you the number of grams you entered in its new weight measurement!
* To use the "Clear" button, simply 'double click', this maneuver done to prevent accidental deletions in the 'input' field.
